## About Me

My name is Phil Malle, and I grew up in a small town in Austria, where I spent much of my time playing football with friends. After finishing school, I decided to pursue an apprenticeship. Although my initial goal was to work with computers, I ended up training as a surface technician.  

After completing my apprenticeship and working in the field for several years, I transitioned into the technology sector as a scripter. This role allowed me to expand my knowledge in programming and SCCM. During this time, I also began part-time studies in network technology at FH Klagenfurt.  

Over the years, I explored various roles, including software development and network engineering. My time as a network technician was particularly rewarding, as I gained valuable experience and earned two Cisco certifications.  

However, my passion for cybersecurity had always been present. In 2020, I began dedicating my free time to learning penetration testing on platforms like TryHackMe. This journey deepened my interest and led me to explore additional platforms such as HackTheBox, VulnHub, and PentesterLab.  

This hands-on experience eventually opened the door to a career in cybersecurity. I transitioned from networking to the SOC (Security Operations Center) field in May 2021, where I now focus on cyber defense. I currently hold the **eJPT (eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester)** certification and am actively preparing for additional certifications, including **PNPT (Practical Network Penetration Tester)**, **RTO1 (Red Team Operator Level 1)**, and many more.  

I continue to expand my knowledge through platforms like BlueTeamLabs and Security Blue Team, as well as by staying engaged with the latest developments in the cybersecurity field.

## My Private Background

Outside of work, I enjoy a fulfilling personal life. Together with my wife, we’ve built a home filled with love, two cats, and a dog. I’m also a proud father, and spending time with my family is one of my greatest joys. Watching my son grow and develop his skills is a daily source of happiness.  

In my free time, I enjoy swimming and playing football during the winter months. Our family is also growing, as we’re expecting our second child soon—a new chapter I’m eagerly looking forward to.
